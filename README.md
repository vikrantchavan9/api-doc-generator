Stop wasting hours writing API documentation! Our tool takes your raw JSON data and instantly converts it into clean, understandable documentation using AI ‚Äî so you can focus on building, not explaining.

---

üìå What It Does

- Accepts a raw JSON schema or object from the user.
- Parses all API fields and generates human-readable descriptions.
- Uses Google Gemini API to generate intelligent, natural language explanations for each field.
- Lets users edit, copy, and download the documentation in JSON or Markdown format.
- Built with accessibility, responsiveness, and dark/light theming in mind.

üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (via API Gateway)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via REST API)
- **Storage/Hosting**:
  - **Frontend** hosted on Vercel
  - **Lambda Function** deployed on AWS
  - **Optional EC2** for testing load/local Gemini proxy

AWS Lambda ‚Äì Core Business Logic

We used AWS Lambda to implement the main backend logic for handling AI generation requests. This made our app:

- Serverless ‚Äì no need to maintain infrastructure.
- Scalable ‚Äì auto-adjusts to request volume.
- Lightweight ‚Äì only invoked on request, saving cost.

Lambda Responsibilities:

- Receives JSON fields from the frontend.
- Constructs a natural-language prompt.
- Sends the prompt to Gemini AI API.
- Parses the Gemini response and returns formatted descriptions to the frontend.

AWS API Gateway

- Set up a **POST endpoint** to connect the frontend to the Lambda function.
- Handles CORS and request routing to Lambda.
- Ensures secure, scalable, and cost-effective communication between client and backend.

AWS S3 (Optional)

- Used for hosting static assets (e.g., docs, logo).
- Could also be used to store generated documentation in future versions.

AWS EC2 (Optional)

- For local testing and hosting an alternate Gemini proxy.
- Not essential in final architecture but useful during development.

What We Learned

- How to integrate AWS Lambda and API Gateway for serverless deployment.
- Prompt engineering techniques for LLMs like Gemini.
- Handling CORS, request validation, and JSON parsing in serverless environments.
- Frontend patterns for live documentation rendering.
- Styling consistency using Radix + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.

---

Challenges We Faced

- **CORS errors** with Lambda and API Gateway integration.
- Lambda function size limits due to bundling `node_modules`.
- Ensuring AI-generated descriptions were accurate and parseable as JSON.
- Frontend UX challenges in editing deeply nested fields.

---

Accomplishments

- Fully working MVP deployed with serverless backend.
- Clean and modern UI/UX ready for developers.
- Achieved high performance scores (Lighthouse/PageSpeed).
- Scalable, extensible architecture for future enhancements.

---

What's Next?

- Add support for OpenAPI (Swagger) schema uploads.
- Enable PDF export of generated documentation.
- Allow team collaboration and shared docs via Supabase.
- Add example values + field constraints in the output.
- Premium tier with bulk upload and branding options.
